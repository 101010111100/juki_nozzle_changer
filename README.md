Assembly:

Please use a wide and flat sanding file for better adhering parts together, also use thin fine sanding files to make top surface and sliding ramp path smooth. Teflon spray coating is strongly recommended for silky smooth action and prolong the life of there parts. You will need a good plastic adhesive cement for final assembly. But, take care of clip when apply adhesive cement around - it should move freely.

Nozzle holding sequence:

 1. Holder moves down at the nozzle locating home position while outer ring sleeve moves toward upside enough.
 2. Holder slides horizontally toward ramp opening and leaves home with the nozzle dragging together.
 3. Nozzle moves upward a little bit (1mm) in the sequence at above and connects with the holder.
 4. Next, outher ring sleeve moves downward (2mm) and expand spring fully (at the top surface down slope part).
 5. Nozzle leaves from the changer and holding process is done.
